            <h2>Starting from the very beginning</h2> 
            <p>The project was prepared in cooperation with the developer for the private chef. The company name has been changed for this project.</p>
                <p>For this project, we didn't have any materials: no logo, no brand guidelines, and no first reviews of the services.</p>
                    <p>
                        
Based on the questionnaire completed by the client, I built a brief that served as a base.

                    <p>"Will provide users with general information about the company's purpose and the chef. 
                        Will inform users of available services. An event calander w/options to pre-book events. 
                        Client intake form. Chef portfolio &amp; reviews. Introductory video (not yet made). 
                        Application Portal for inquiries to work with/for The Golden Knifes 
                        (servers, hosts, photographers, cooks, prep, etc). I'd like to add some form of "secret" 
                        button kind of hidden in plain sight. The button will take users to another page for 
                        premium exclusive clientele that offers late night/discreet service after midnight for single parties up to 4."</p>

                    <p>
                        Direct but not aggressive; subtle, but not shy; luxurious &amp; exclusive; less is more</p>
                        <h5>Style</h5>

               <h2>Proposal</h2>
               <p>
                Considering the budget and requirements to start building digital appearance we proposed:
               </p>
        </div>
        <div>
                <div class="flex-item-border">
                <p class="item-border">design 5 pages + Vip Section <br>(why 5 is explained at the end of the story)</p>
                <p class="item-border">CMS implementation - Strapi</p>
                <p class="item-border">implementation of a tool for analyzing website traffic and activity - Google Analytics</p>
                <p class="item-border">two selected ready-to-go plugins - e.g. Calendly</p>
                <p class="item-border">copywriting - apart from "about us" - here we suggest only changes</p>

    </div>
    <h5>
        What we suggested to drop off for this moment and why:
    </h5> 
    <p>
        I suggested introducing other functionalities such as Event Calendar / Subscription capabilities / Waitlist (subscriptions &amp; tickets) 
        at a later time to fit into the current budget and because the client had not been prepared for that yet. 
        <p>Together we rejected the concept 
        of a section in the CMS for subcontractors because it would generate unnecessary costs at this stage. 
        We can add this using 
        Strapi functionalities in the future.</p>
        <p>
            The above functions are not needed to start a business and may generate high costs for someone who is new on the market.

<!--SUMMARY-->
    <div class="full-width">
        <div class="container">
        <div class="grid-container-2">
            
           <div>
            <h2>Takeways</h2>
       
        
            <p>The project wasn't deployed because of client private issues. Nevertheless, working with real briefs and clients shows that <strong> 
                are always some constraints that we need to address and deal with.</strong> No matter if it is a budget, timelines, or just client taste and problems. 
                Thanks to this project, <strong>I improved my questionnaire for web design to make it more approachable and easy to understand.</strong> I cut off 
                all technical questions and questions about future and possible plans. As a designer, I need to consider those things (
                    together with the developer) so clients can offer flexible, tailored services and grow their businesses.

            </p>

        </div>
    
            <div>
            <div>
                <h5>Design decision</h5>
                <p>We decided to remove the Services tab due to the lack of a full offer - the development of this topic depends on the client's development direction.<br>
                    The basic requirement was to achieve luxury and elegance, so I used black and gold for this project. For a more elegant look, 
                    I introduce a traditional serif font for headlines and a sans serif font for the body.<br>
                    Knowing that the website will be built in Strapi from reusable components, 
                    I try to make the UI as simple as possible to not waste time re-coding those elements too much by the developer.
                   </p>
            </div> 
            <div>
                <h5>Usability</h5>
                <p>The form was cut off from elements that could be troubling for the clients - like age, social status, etc. 
                    I include only the necessary information that allows the company to prepare the offers.<br>
                    Looking at the sample menu from the home page as a model pop-up is a good approach for building engagement step-by-step. 
                    We don't demand total immersion to give the users a small taste of what they can experience. 
                
                </p>    
            </div> 
            <div>
                <h5>Accessibility</h5>
                <p>All the UI components, as well as backgrounds and body text, were tested for AAA standard contrast ratio accessibility. </p>    
            </div> 
        </div>
