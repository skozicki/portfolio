                <p>
                    Redesign of the existing ViaEurasia application implemented as part of the UI course. The aim was to
                    consider feedback from real users and the creative director of Culture Routes Society and design a
                    new layout for some screens.</p>

            <div class="flex-item">

                <div class="item">

                    <p>Navigation within the app is confusing.</p>
                    <p>There are more screens than necessary.</p>
                    <p>The branding and color feel dated and unsophisticated, and they don’t follow accessibility
                        guidelines.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <h5>Creative director notes</h5>
                    <p>The app’s “Home” page looks like a legal document and is uninviting.
                        Experiment by moving the sponsor logos and information to the “About” page.
                        The layout of the “About” page should then be reorganized to make it more visually appealing.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once all the legal text and sponsor logos have been removed from the “Home” page,
                        design a new logo and create an impactful “Welcome” page (to replace “Home”).</p>

                    <p>Remove the “Check Before You Go” page and replace it with a new menu that includes
                        the same 3 button topics (Route Updates, Weather, Guide Book).</p>

                    <p>Via Eurasia’s brand typeface is Inter, which you shouldn’t change. You can, however,
                        adjust the size and weight of the text on each page to create a better hierarchy
                        and improve accessibility.</p>

                    <p>Not every Frame needs a complete redesign, but they should all be improved from
                        an accessibility standpoint. You might choose to keep the same layout for
                        “Routes,” “Route Detail,” or “Points of Interest” and just update the brand
                        colors to comply with accessibility best practices, for instance.</p>

            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Readability:</strong> A light background better exposes the logo, name of the app and
                greeting.<br>
                <strong>Aesthetics:</strong>I chose orange (a color of energy and activity) for the buttons and other
                elements to be emphasized.
                With a uniform ground and a color scheme in the range of white and light gray, it will be very easy to
                introduce a possible dark mode,
                which is trendy and valuable at present (2023). Plus, it's giving the app a modern minimalist look.
                The overall look of the app was modeled on the new version of Airbnb, which is getting rave reviews from
                designers.<br>
                <strong>Bonus:</strong>The size of the EU logos was verified with the EU requirements for project
                marking.

            <h4>Design decisions
            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Easy navigation:</strong> I decided to use only the top navigation as a tab to minimize
                the number of navigation elements that could confuse the user with such a simple design.<br>
                <strong>Usability:</strong> I introduced the acronym "POI" (point of interest),
                commonly used in applications with routing capabilities or a database of default routes.
                Also, I have dropped the arrow suggesting the length of the route due to the lack of common use
                of this element in other travel apps.<br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> The entire app has a solid background with slight graphics
                from the logo - a subtle way of branding the app; thanks to the divergent darker background, the white
                card maintain the principle “the light comes from above.”

            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Easy navigation:</strong> To avoid adding a burger/kebab menu, I created a third item in the top
                navigation:
                MORE, as a drawer. Clicking on each item will take you to a particular screen from which,
                via the "back arrow," the user will return to the ROUTS screen. I also added an overlay to
                highlight the contents of the drawer better.<br>
                <strong>Readability:</strong> I also added an overlay to
                highlight the contents of the drawer better.<br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> The icons are supportive and enhance the aesthetic experience.

            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Usability:</strong> Isolating the button along with the distance information
                is a proven way to increase the chances of the user using this functionality.<br>
                <strong>Readability:</strong> Increasing the interline in the body copy provides better readability.<br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Introducing margins for the map image is a consistency across the app
                behavior, just like introducing a white background for the top navigation.

            <h4>Design decisions
            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Usability:</strong> I didn't understand where the filtering results came from,
                so I permanently made the search bar with the filtering option (icon on the right) on this screen.
                Leaving the bar on the search results page will allow the user to change their search preferences more
                easily - he will not have to go to this screen to adjust search parameters.<br>
                <strong>Readability:</strong>
                Enlarging icons to emphasize the convenience of a given location.<br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Introducing cards with basic-level elevation is a behavior-consistent
                layout with a more attractive appearance than the usual list. In addition,
                I have changed the typography hierarchy to emphasize the names of the searched places, but perhaps the
                distance issue should be more critical. Icons were given an orange to make the eye naturally wander in
                their direction.

            <h4>Design decisions
            </h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Usability:</strong> Dividing content into drop-down sections gives the user power over what is
                displayed at any given time, so he can choose what he wants to read first and not scroll endlessly
                through the screen<br>
                <strong>Readability:</strong> Increasing text readability by increasing line hight.<br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Introducing foot pagination is another way of branding the product and
                introducing a bit of "fun". As suggested, the sponsors' logos and the disclaimer from HOME have been
                placed here as separate sections.

            <h2>Let's see if I achieve the goal</h2>

            <div class="grid-container-2">

                <div>

                    <div class="item">
                        <h5>User feedback</h5>
                        <p>A. Navigation within the app is confusing.</p>
                        <p>B. There are more screens than necessary.</p>
                        <p>C. The branding and color feel dated and unsophisticated, and they don’t follow accessibility
                            guidelines.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>How I used user feedback
                        </h5>
                        <p class="item-border"><strong>A:</strong> Introduction more intuitive navigation.<br>
                            <strong>A, B:</strong> Introduction of MORE tab and drawer.<br>
                            <strong>C:</strong> Change the color scheme and use one color as an accent;
                            <br>Improving readability by adjusting colors with an appropriate contrast ratio, improving
                            typography and line hight. <br>

                <div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <h5>Creative director notes</h5>
                        <p>A. The app’s “Home” page looks like a legal document and is uninviting.
                            Experiment by moving the sponsor logos and information to the “About” page.
                            The layout of the “About” page should then be reorganized to make it more visually
                            appealing.</p>

                        <p>B. Once all the legal text and sponsor logos have been removed from the “Home” page,
                            design a new logo and create an impactful “Welcome” page (to replace “Home”).</p>

                        <p>C. Remove the “Check Before You Go” page and replace it with a new menu that includes
                            the same 3 button topics (Route Updates, Weather, Guide Book).</p>

                        <p>D. Via Eurasia’s brand typeface is Inter, which you shouldn’t change. You can, however,
                            adjust the size and weight of the text on each page to create a better hierarchy
                            and improve accessibility.</p>

                        <p>E. Not every Frame needs a complete redesign, but they should all be improved from
                            an accessibility standpoint. You might choose to keep the same layout for
                            “Routes,” “Route Detail,” or “Points of Interest” and just update the brand
                            colors to comply with accessibility best practices, for instance.</p>

                        <p class="item-border">
                            <strong>A:</strong> Moved the suggested elements, improving the logo, changed the color
                            scheme;
                            Use accordion for About screen to reduce scrolling and give a lighter look.<br>
                            <strong>B:</strong> Creating a Welcome screen.<br>
                            <strong>C:</strong> Adding the drawer.<br>
                            <strong>D:</strong> Create a style sheet for typography and apply it consistently throughout
                            the application.
                            Unification of the entire application according to the established typography color scale
                            and new navigation.<br>
                            <strong>E:</strong> To maintain consistency in the project, other screens have also been
                            redesigned.

            <h4>Aspects that were a challenge in this project:</h4>
            <p><strong>Searching for solutions for specific needs</strong> - on the one hand, it is sometimes difficult
                to limit yourself to only the guidelines.
                Still, on the other hand, the limitations allow you to achieve your goals in a given time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Simple and logical structure</strong> - sometimes the simple solutions are the hardest to solve.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The irresistible desire to add more functionalities</strong> - this is entirely unjustified in
                the business world because it generates additional costs and wastes time.
